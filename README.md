# Latters Count Program!
## Descriptions:
### This program counts the number of latters in a file! Both the exe (CMD1.exe) and the file to analyze (Constitution_of_the_United_States.html) are in the same folder and used together on the command line of the console window. In order to count the latters, I've created a function first. Later in the main section, I simply dragged the function to display the latters count. 
## How is it usefull?
### From this program, you will get to how to use "if else" statement, I/O manipulators, pass argument, and specify the name of the file from the command line to analyze when the program is run
